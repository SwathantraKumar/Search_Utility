Utility to search the usage of a field in large code base STACK trace
This program searches a property/string within a program execution flow and writes the results to a file.
This is usefull when we have to see the usage of a property within a program flow which has very huge code base for which debugging is difficult.

I used this to search for an array of elements which is used in the program flow which is designed on a Unibasic platform.

Usecases:
  1. Research the huge logs draw conclusions on the results.
  2. Research the code base and do impact analysis of a property change.
